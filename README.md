# Spring Boot Application with Spring Data JPA and JWT Tokens

This is a sample Spring Boot application demonstrating CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA with JWT tokens for authentication and authorization. The application provides RESTful APIs for managing resources with proper validation and verification.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
- Maven
- Git

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <[repository_url](https://github.com/Md-Danish-Saifi/SpringDataJPA-JWT-Crud.git)>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SpringDataJPA-JWT-Crud
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/spring-boot-jpa-jwt-crud.jar
   ```

5. The application will start, and you can access the APIs at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration

The application can be configured using the following properties:

- `spring.datasource.url`: JDBC URL of the database.
- `spring.datasource.username`: Database username.
- `spring.datasource.password`: Database password.
- `jwt.secret`: Secret key used for JWT token generation and validation.
- `jwt.expirationMs`: Token expiration time in milliseconds.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following RESTful endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/signup`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/signin`: Authenticate and generate JWT token.
- `GET /api/contact/{id}`: Retrieve contact by ID.
- `PUT /api/contact/{id}`: Update contact details.
- `DELETE /api/contact/{id}`: Delete contact by ID.

## Authentication

Authentication is done using JWT tokens. To access protected resources, include the JWT token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request.

Example Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_token>`

## Validation and Verification

All incoming requests are validated for data integrity and verified for authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. Proper error responses are returned for invalid requests.
